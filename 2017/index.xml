      <description>Simple linear regression Introduction This is again a collection of notes about stats and finance, with focus on covariance, correlation and simple linear regression, the idea here is to analyse some tools to measure risk. For a better representation let&amp;#39;s get some Bovespa companies from the sector of Cyclic Consumption, they are: MGLU3, BTOW3, LAME3, LREN3.
Getting financial data import pandas as pd import numpy as np import pandas_datareader as web import matplotlib.</description>

      <description>Sample space An experiment is a process that, when performed, results in one and only one of many observations. These observations are called outcomes of the experiment. The collection of all outcomes for an experiment is called a sample space.
| Experiment | Outcomes | Sample Space | |------------------|-------------|-------------------| | Roll a die | 1,2,3,4,5,6 | S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} | | Tooss a coin once| Head, Tail | S = {Head, Tail} |</description>

      <description>Descriptive Measures Measures of Central tendency for Ungrouped data Mean Or the arithimetic mean, is the most frequently used measure of central tendency, the mean is the sum of all values / number of values.
import numpy as np np.mean([1, 3, 6, 10, 20, 50]) # 15.0
Median Is the value of the middle term in a dataset that has been ranked in increasing order. If the dataset is odd the median is given by the value of the middle term, if even the median is given by the average of the values of the two middle terms.</description>
