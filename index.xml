      <description>Network policy This post documents a few steps to test the E2E framework using the Kind cluster with different CNIs, giving the developer some good tooling for debugging and quick test replication.
Use this script to bring a Kind cluster with a specific CNI setup.
Finding the config parameters In the ~/.kube/config you can find the Cluster sections host, use the IP and Port to start the tests.

      <description>Introduction   On Kubernetes 1.10+ a new way to configure Kubelet via YAML became v1beta1, the struct KubeletConfiguration become available via the –config flag. So most of the regular ones can be configured via this file. This approach is extensively used by kubeadm for setting up the installation as was noted in last post.  The idea of this post now is to do a code walkthrough and take a look in some KEPs and designs for the subsystem that reload this configuration at flight giving Kubelet a Dynamic Configuration capacity, this feature became beta on 1.</description>

      <description>Introduction   This post reflects some work on setting up a development environment for Kubernetes. We must have Goland, Virtualbox, Delve and MacOS installed. If you&amp;#39;re using Linux probably the vm part is not necessary. Installing the tools  VirtualBox   Since we are on MacOSX, and Kubelet nodes works only on Linux and Windows the setup of a vm is necessary for this step a Debian Buster image is going to be used, the Virtualbox is 6.</description>

For this post only the main Spec of the Pod object is going to be detailed with examples and tasks, we let the container configuration for other posts. Get after it.

      <description>Introduction   Sawtooth has two different kinds of permissioning, the first is the transaction permissioning, it controls who (user/clients) can submit transactions and batches to a validator, the second is validator key permissioning, this controls which nodes can connect to the Sawtooth network, only available with on-chain settings.  For this debugging and testing scenario we will have 2 nodes:  version: &amp;#34;2.1&amp;#34; services: v1: image: hyperledger/sawtooth-validator:1.1 container_name: v1 command: bash expose: - 8000 v2: image: hyperledger/sawtooth-validator:1.</description>

      <description>Introduction   The idea of this post is to test the Audit dynamic backend with a KIND cluster.  Kubernetes has 4 stages: RequestReceived - The stage for events generated as soon as the audit handler receives the request, and before it is delegated down the handler chain.  ResponseStarted - Once the response headers are sent, but before the response body is sent. This stage is only generated for long-running requests (e.</description>

      <description>Introduction   This is an overview and notes on how to use the client-go Kubernetes API. Kubernetes API resources  Accessing via API   The API is versioned for extensability propose, the levels are Alpha level (v1alpha1), Beta (b2beta3) stabel (v1).  You can notice the groups of the resources exists inside the version. To access the endpoints directly start the proxy with  $ kubectl proxy --port=8080 $ curl http://localhost:8080/apis/ # To dig deeper in versions and existent resources $ kubectl api-resources &amp;amp;&amp;amp; kubectl api-version Accessing via client-go   Its possible to access a Pod via a clientset and fetch attributes from it, in the example bellow, it must fetch the Image from a CoreDNS container in the Kube-system namespace.</description>

      <description>Introduction   DevMode is very cool for development of transaction processors, but when you go to production it don&amp;#39;t grant a correct fork resolution of your chain, and you can end up with different HEAD in the nodes.  Some Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocols were created to fix this problem, in version 1.0.5 we have the famous PoET, when used with SGX (intel protection) it can guarantee the BFT characteristic.</description>

It&amp;#39;s easier with instrumentation to get a snapshot of your system state in a particular time, the one can discovery outliers and misbehaviors and if you need more details you always have debugging logs.</description>

      <description>Sawtooth   A RUST permissioned/permissionless distribuded ledger created by Intel, an official project under the Hyperledger umbrella.  From the characteristics of the sawtooth we can have: distributed, immutable, secure.  There&amp;#39;s a separation between the application level and the core system. It provides smartcontract abstraction that allows application developers to write contract logic in a language of their choice.  An application can be a native business logic or a smart contract virtual machine.</description>

The environment I used were basically a CoreOS cluster with some peculiarities, like starting services remote with fleet (like kubectl). The setup were composed of a etcd/fleet cluster with 3 machines and units being deployed with an external FLEETCTL_TUNNEL variable.</description>

      <description>Introduction   The post today is about fun, Kali Linux and Android apps hacking. Check it out!  Why? Because people hide your access and don&amp;#39;t provide you a plain, well structured and easy to use API, no SDK, nothing. You are probalby locked in those apps, that normally share less than what you want. Host enumeration   The good old nmap should do the trick, find your network subnet, scan your hosts and look for obvious MAC address like Samsung Eletronics, for this post propouse we do have access to the cellphone, so obviously this step is not necessary.</description>

      <description>Introduction   Django [1] is awesome, it applies a lot of design patterns in different layers. First of you have the model layer, or the abstraction layer (models), you can define models that maps to the tables of your database. We are going to see some features that the Django ORM offers.  On the other side, Phoenix Framework [2] is a web framework written in Elixir, it applies the MVC pattern too, and have Ecto as a &amp;#34;language integrated query composition tool&amp;#34; and a database wrapper.</description>

      <description>Introduction   Python Weekly this week bring a very cool article [1] about GDB and Python, so I thought it was a great opportunity to get into Python internals, the idea here is to understand (in more details) how Python executes your scripts and how it calls code functions.  The code is very simple, and uses the random module with two built-in functions (range and sorted), the question is: Can we via GDB see the stack of it?</description>

      <description>Introduction   Everybody lives Python, the syntax is fast to get used to and you can write most of your code on a constant pattern if you follow the PEP8. Lots of libraries are available and the community is vibrant and enthusiastic with the evolution of the language.  For this exercise, the goal will be create a piece of code on Python that does the same thing on Golang.</description>

      <description>Introduction   On the last post we started prometheus on a CoreOS with cloud-init scripts, lets automate a little more the project an initialize our CoreOS dockers with service discovery for all services and a complete metric gather from an external MySQL database.  So we already have an infrastructure, we just need two more containers, the first one is the MySQL metrics exporter, and the other is Grafana with Prometheus configured.</description>

      <description>Introduction   Consul is a Service Discovery system, on a microservice architecture for example, we have some external and internal services laying around. There is a complexity in the setup and orchestration of these services which are being setup and destroyed all the time.  A long term solution to the problem is to use DNS, an address name resolver. It is a mature and larger used protocol, but we can find some issues nowadays: How can it know if the service is down or up?</description>

      <description>Introduction   In this post we are going to analyze a very interesting Erlang distributed load testing tool, called Tsung [1]. The cool things about this tool is the complete HTML report of each connection made.  NOTE If you are interested on real traffic replication, consider this project [2]. Configuration   On tsung.xml we start the test plan, you can include here the list of clients, servers, the number/load time, as other sessions definitions.</description>
