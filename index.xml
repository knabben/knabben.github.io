      <description>** Introduction
Continuous Deployment and Continuous Integration are topics that you can evolve and improve forever. The best reading on it IMO is [1] by Jez Humble, and it will be the guide for this post.
&amp;ldquo;The time from deciding that you need to make a change to having it in production is known as the cycle time, and it is a vital metric for any project.&amp;rdquo;
What we want here is do reduce the cycle time of the project in a reliable, secure and low-risk way, an automated process that is trusted enough to not be rolledback.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post we are going to analyze a very interesting Erlang distributed load testing tool, called Tsung [1]. The cool things about this tool is the complete HTML report of each connection made.
NOTE If you are interested on real traffic replication, consider this project [2].
Configuration On tsung.xml we start the test plan, you can include here the list of clients, servers, the number/load time, as other sessions definitions.</description>
